# Project-3---Purple-Team

Project 3 was a collaborative project for the UPENN Data Science and Visualization Bootcamp.  Its members were Kyle Taveira Tener, Julian Hahm, Sarah Schilling, and Luis Herran.  The goal of this project was to use a dataset and perform a combined analysis of the provided information.  From that information we were then tasked at creating interactive visualizations in order to portray our discoveries.  

We decided to use a dataset that used customer reviews to help determine different drug perfomance values across different illnesses. Our group focused on the creation of a SQL database to house the dataset.  From there we used the python skills and libraries gathered, to create the analysis and visualizations.
